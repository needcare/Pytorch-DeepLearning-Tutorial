        "- Recurring in Maths is simply the repettition of a decimal or an expression.\n",
        "- A recurrence relation is an equation that defines a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of the previous term(s).\n",
        "- The simplest form of a recurrence relation is the case where the next term depends only on the immediately previous term.\n",
